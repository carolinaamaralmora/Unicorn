## What is a Technical Writer?

A technical Writer is a communicator who transforms complex technical content into simple and clear information. Their aim is to instruct their audience through documentation, manuals, guides, briefs, summaries, reports, articles, press releases, white papers, tech books, ebooks, etc. These hold technical information from a variety of fields such as engineering, operations, machinery and industries, transport, IT, communication, etc.
In the past, a Technical Writer needed an Engineering Bachelors or Masters. However, nowadays, there are more professionals from an English, Journalism or Communications background.

### Audience:

But to whom are you writing to?

- Direct-to-consumer: to consumers or end-users, where you simplify a product or service (eg: guides, manuals, descriptions, etc)
- Expert-to-expert: to skilled professionals in an industry (eg: whitepapers, legal, analysis, reviewes, reports, papers, etc)
- Marketing communications: to specific market products/services/processes (business proposals, pitches, promotional brochures, case studies, chain emails, articles, etc)

### Principles:

What are the main pillars of a technical writer's job?

- Write for an audience: who are you writing to? A day-to-day user or a skilled tech? Maybe a CEO who does not understand a a damn thing of the product you are presenting in the company you work? Do you want an advice? Keep it to the 8th grade level so everyone can understand what you have to say!
- Write to solve problems: come with solutions to your audience! Please avoid using technical jargon! Not everyone is an expert! 
- Write the right information: research, research, research! Be sure you have the correct information about a product/process/service.
- Write clear and readable sentences: once again, 8th grade level and short sentences! Do not use the passive voice as it lengthens a sentence and the ability of the brain to make sense of any of it. Also, keep contractions and idiomatic expressions out of the picture, since not everyone is a native speaker of your language!
- Write "visually": the eyes like it too, right? When was the last time you chose the ugly dish at a restaurant? Besides, graphics and visuals can help organizing and clarifying information.

### Process:

Now what? Where do you start?

- Pre-write: what is the purpose and the format? What is your audience? What about the timing and the type of message you want to give?
- Research: what is your product? What contracts and specifics do you need to take care of? Don't forget to deep research your audience!
- Draft: I think this one is self-explanatory, right? Keep it simple, flexible and re-write any times!
- Revise, edit and proofread: read it again and write more! Ask a subject matter expert (SME) or a colleague for help and feedback! 

### Level of Edit

And then you need to edit it... manuy times! There are basically 3 stages of editing a document:
1) Grammar and spelling
2) Document layout for visual readibility
3) Content and structure or internal organization! (This is where some Design knowledge might come handy!)

### Resources

Usually, if you work in a company, you will have a Style guide, where you will base all your writing on!
However, there are also commercial style guides. Some of the good ones are bellow: 

- *The CSE Manual for Authors*
- *The APA Publication Manual*
- *The Chicago Manual of Style* (my favorite!)
- Dictionaries and Grammars.

## From a Creative to Tech?

After reading the information above, I guess you have some questions. So what is the difference between a Technical Writer and a Copywriter? Can I still be a creative and a Technical writer?
To the first question I can say that the main differences between these 2 writers are: the goal (or what aptlearn.io calls purpose), the audicence (this could be named as context) and the format (or structure).

> Content writing has other names - SEO writing, internet writing. Basically, a content writer is someone who fills websites with content on various topics and aims at reaching a specific audience. Content writers always have search engines and keywords in mind because these are sure ways to connect to the right readers and bring them to a website. Technical writing is quite different. It is all about simplifying complex things and creating instructions in different forms (online help, training documentation, user guides, etc.). So, we see that the definitions are far from being alike.

I would say a Technical Writer can be a Content Writer, but it does not necessarily mean that a Content Writer ican be a Technical Writer! I think with this, I am answering the last question. Yes, you can still be a creative writer, just with a different format and audience!

Lastly, can you still became a Technical Writer with a Copywriting backgournd or no background at all? Yes! Read the rest for more hints!

## The skills!

You will need *soft* and *hard* skills! This basically translates into attitude and tool knowledge!
The *soft* skills are the most important thing! I started with them and here I am writing this document with Markdown format (basically, a HTML converter tool for non-tech people like us!)

***Badass* attitude:**
- First, be bold and be open to learn a lot!
- Be communicative and have good editing skills too, because you need it, right? Write a lot and read even more, specially the formats of writing I mentioned in the beginning!
- Technical skills! You do not have to be a software developer, but you got to be IT inclined! You will definitely need it for all the tools you will use!
- Be a good researcher, because a big part of this job is searching for the right information! I used to write papers in college and articles, so this helped a lot!
- Design skills are optional, but they put you in a place of advantage! Page Design and Graphics here are very important to enrich and clarify your content! I love Canva, a very basic tool to create fun templates!

## The Tools?
Because I have the *badass* attitude, I ended up self-learning some of the most used tools in the industry.

So, the **tools**?
- Publishing tools: the tools where you publish our work for everyone to see! It can be: Adobe FrameMaker, Document360. None of these tools are free, so you can play around with some demos, but, eventually, you will have to purchase them.
- Spell tools: to check your grammar. Good examples are: Grammarly, AutoCrit, GoogleDocs and ProWritingAid.
- Image Editing tools: because you need to make it pretty too! Eg: Adobe Photoshop, Canva, PickMonkey, Pixlr
- Authoring Tools: The classic tools where you actually write, like: MSWord, Google Docs, Markdown editors, etc.
- Screen capture tools: If you need a clarifying picture or video of a specific step or process, you can use TechSmith, Snag-It, Fire Shot.


## And now what?

And now you can start learning and playing with some of the tools and courses I mentioned above!
You can also move further into Git and Github (only after you feel comfortable with this) or even UX Writing (if you're into microcopy, basically really short sentences for users to click on in apps and websites!)
One final peace of advise: create your own portfolio, even if you do not have experience, use the tools and do something! Research on things you like and write about them! And connect with the people that work in the industry on LinkedIn for instance! they can offer you great advice on how to get your first job in the area! The rest comes with time!

Good luck!
