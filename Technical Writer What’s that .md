## What is a Technical Writer?

A Technical Writer is a communicator who transforms complex technical content into simple and clear information. They aim to instruct their audience through documentation, manuals, guides, briefs, summaries, reports, articles, press releases, white papers, tech books, ebooks, etc. These hold technical information from a variety of fields such as engineering, operations, machinery and industries, transport, IT, communication, etc.
In the past, a Technical Writer needed an Engineering Bachelor's or Master's degree. However, nowadays, there are more professionals from an English, Journalism, or Communications background.

### Audience:

But to whom are you writing?

- Direct-to-consumer: to consumers or end-users, where you simplify a product or service (eg: guides, manuals, descriptions, etc)
- Expert-to-expert: to skilled professionals in an industry (eg: whitepapers, legal, analysis, reviews, reports, papers, etc)
- Marketing communications: to specific market products/services/processes (business proposals, pitches, promotional brochures, case studies, chain emails, articles, etc)

### Principles:

What are the main pillars of a Technical Writer's job?

- Write for an audience: who are you writing to? A day-to-day user or a skilled tech? Maybe a CEO who does not understand a damn thing about the product you are presenting in the company you work for? Do you want a piece of advice? Keep it to the 8th-grade level so everyone can understand what you have to say!
- Write to solve problems: come up with solutions for your audience! Please avoid using technical jargon! Not everyone is an expert! 
- Write the right information: research, research, research! Be sure you have the correct information about a product/process/service.
- Write clear and readable sentences: once again, 8th-grade level and short sentences! Do not use the passive voice as it lengthens a sentence and the brain´s ability to make sense of any of it. Also, keep contractions and idiomatic expressions out of the picture, since not everyone is a native speaker of your language!
- Write "visually": the eyes like it too, right? When was the last time you chose an ugly dish at a restaurant? Besides, graphics and visuals can help organize and clarify information.

### Process:

Now what? Where do you start?

- Pre-write: what is the purpose and the format? What is your audience? What about the timing and the type of message you want to give?
- Research: what is your product? What contracts and specifics do you need to take care of? Do not forget to deep research your audience!
- Draft: I think this one is self-explanatory, right? Keep it simple, flexible, and re-write any time!
- Revise, edit, and proofread: read it again and write more! Ask a subject matter expert (SME) or a colleague for help and feedback! 

### Level of Edit

And then you need to edit it... many times! There are 3 stages of editing a document:
1) Grammar and spelling
2) Document layout for visual readability
3) Content and structure or internal organization! (This is where some Design knowledge might come in handy!)

### Resources

Usually, if you work in a company, you will have its style guide, on which you will base all your writing!
However, there are also commercial style guides. Some of the good ones are below: 

- *The CSE Manual for Authors*
- *The APA Publication Manual*
- *The Chicago Manual of Style* (my favorite!)
- Dictionaries and Grammar.

## From a Creative to Tech?

After reading the information above, I guess you have some questions. So what is the difference between a Technical Writer and a Copywriter? Can I still be a creative and a Technical writer?
To the first question, I can say that the main differences between these 2 writers are: the goal (or what aptlearn.io calls purpose), the audience (this could be named context), and the format (or structure).

> Content writing has other names - SEO writing, and internet writing. A content writer is someone who fills websites with content on various topics and aims at reaching a specific audience. Content writers always have search engines and keywords in mind because these are sure ways to connect to the right readers and bring them to a website. Technical writing is quite different. It is all about simplifying complex things and creating instructions in different forms (online help, training documentation, user guides, etc.). So, we see that the definitions are far from being alike.

I would say a Content Writer can be a Technical Writer, but it does not necessarily mean that a Technical Writer can be a Content Writer! I think, by stating this, I am answering the last question. Yes, you can still be a creative writer, just with a different format and audience!

Lastly, can you still become a Technical Writer with a Copywriting background or no background at all? Yes! Read the rest for more hints!

## The skills!

You will need *soft* and *hard* skills! This translates into attitude and tool knowledge!
The *soft* skills are the most important thing! I started with them and here I am writing this document in Markdown format (basically, an HTML converter tool for non-tech people like us!)

***Badass* attitude:**
- First, be bold and be open to learning a lot!
- Be communicative and have good editing skills too, because you need it, right? Write a lot and read even more, especially the formats of writing I mentioned in the beginning!
- Technical skills! You do not have to be a software developer, but you got to be IT-inclined! You will need it for all the tools you will use!
- Be a good researcher, because a big part of this job is searching for the right information! I used to write papers and articles in college, so this helped a lot!
- Design skills are optional, but they put you in a place of advantage! Page Design and Graphics here are very important to enrich and clarify your content! I love Canva, a very basic tool to create fun templates!

## The Tools?
Because I have a *badass* attitude, I ended up self-learning some of the most used tools in the industry.

So, the **tools**?
- Publishing tools: the tools where you publish your work for everyone to see! It can be Adobe FrameMaker or Document360. None of these tools are free, so you can play around with some demos, but, eventually, you will have to purchase them.
- Spell tools: to check your grammar. Good examples are Grammarly, AutoCrit, Google Docs, and ProWritingAid.
- Image Editing tools: because you need to make it pretty too! Eg: Adobe Photoshop, Canva, PickMonkey, Pixlr
- Authoring Tools: The classic tools where you write, like MSWord, Google Docs, Markdown editors, etc.
- Screen capture tools: If you need a clarifying picture or video of a specific step or process, you can use TechSmith, Snag-It, or Fire Shot.


## And now what?

And now you can start learning and playing with some of the tools and courses I mentioned above!
You can also move further into Git and Github (only after you feel comfortable with this) or even UX Writing (if you are into microcopy, basically really short sentences for users to click on in apps and websites to enhance user experience!)
One final piece of advice: create your portfolio, even if you do not have experience, use the tools and do something! Research things you like and write about them! And connect with the people that work in the industry on LinkedIn for instance! They can offer you great advice on how to get your first job in the area! The rest comes with time!

Good luck!
